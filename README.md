# inCitu x Accelerate-SF
at [inCitu](https://www.incitu.us/), we are on a mission to democratize city planning and bring the future of the built environment to life through Augmented Reality. 
We make open data more actionable, tangible and accessible to all residents, on the ground level in the streets. 
With our Ai powered generative technology channeled into mobile AR, anyone can simply scan a QR code to interact with the future of their cities in 3D.

# How our product works
We take open data and transform it from numbers and charts to geo anchored 3D models and interactive Augmented Reality.
