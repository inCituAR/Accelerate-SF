# Using QR codes to our projects

In the QRs folder, you can access **QR codes for each of the 90+ SF projects**.<br>
<br>
When scanning a QR, iOS devices will launch an app clip and Android devices will launch instant apps leading to geo anchored AR experiences (note: Android users need to have instant apps enabled)

If users are far from the development site, they will be directed to a web page with the project details, where the can view the 3D model and launch a non anchored AR view. 

To "activate" projects and let people know that they can unlock AR, we place signs and floor decals with QR codes on site.
